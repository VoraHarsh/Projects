'SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea’s leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  —   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump.“We have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,” he said.Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan.20.In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec.9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated.“We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year’s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,” he said.But analysts in the region said the North’s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles.It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile.It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth’s atmosphere without breaking up.In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile.” On Sept.9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test.Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible.In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.
