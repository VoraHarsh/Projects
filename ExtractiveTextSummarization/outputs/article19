'BAGHDAD  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital.The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded.Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle.Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived.Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes.A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire.He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack.An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them.“We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us,” said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast.“If the securities forces can’t protect us, then allow us to do the job.” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials.All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.The United States State Department condemned the attacks.France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.
