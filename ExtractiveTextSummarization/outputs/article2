'After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze.The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City.And yet the city’s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal.In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death.Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder.But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes.Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers.“Here, we have nothing,” she said.When it comes to “  families,” she said, the authorities “don’t really care as much.That’s how I feel.” The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City.The homicides  —   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  —   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands.From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers’ view.The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later.Frustrations build on all sides.Detectives’ phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate.In the meantime, a victim’s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother’s apartment when they find their suspect.He chose the police.His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke.Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches.“There’s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,” a sergeant’s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015.A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, “I’m going to shoot through your window.” Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers’ names, which appear in the reports, and then went home.He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report.Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, “then said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,” Mr. Fernandez’s wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response.The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to “slap” her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because “they are the ones snitching,” her notes say.But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief.A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p.m.when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p.m.The police never came, she wrote in her notes.Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly.Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal.The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers.At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests.They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood.“I need to bring something in today to justify my existence,” Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house.“So now you’re in a small area, and day after day you’re hammering the same community.Of course that community’s eventually going to turn on you.” The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other.Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop.“Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,” said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct.“Not because they wanted to, but because they had to.Because some way or somehow, you can’t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that.” Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven.Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious.Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints.A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people’s concerns and help with investigations.The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest.At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer.People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years.But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers.“That perception really sticks,” he said.The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.Three of the precinct’s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts.When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases.Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder.Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    —   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies.By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median.Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective.In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island.Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence.Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex.Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan.“Any crime in Manhattan has to be solved,” said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s.“The outer boroughs are, like, forgotten.” Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate.Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn.Of last year’s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn.“It’s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,” said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part “because that’s where the money is.” He added: “When de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities.And then he’s done the complete opposite of what he said.It’s just business as usual.” The Bronx’s struggles extend into prosecutions.In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city.And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn’s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases.Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice O’Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney’s office.The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, “I was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they can’t be impartial because they don’t trust the police.” Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzo’s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases.He helped clear a woman’s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber.The mother started calling with tips under a code name  —   about a gun under a car, for example.But she always refused to testify.And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting.New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side.But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block.By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  —   and fed up.Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway.A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor’s permission to do more.Others answered that the young men were only making threats.Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said.The menacing worsened.Mr. Fernandez’s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school.She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist.Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim’s advocate in the district attorney’s office.On Oct.But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed.So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school.At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses.He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each.He could not find one small enough for his daughter.“I have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,” Mr. Fernandez said.“The only thing I know for sure: God, if we’re in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family.” Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating.But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned.“I’m bending over backward, and nobody’s not even doing anything,” he said.“Why am I going to help you, if you ain’t going to help me?” By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector O’Sullivan said.Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles.Mr. Fernandez’s complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings.
