'THOMPSONS, Tex.The technology, carbon capture, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere.But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here, about 30 miles southwest of Houston, is a bright spot for the technology’s supporters.It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget, unlike many previous such projects.That is a fraction of the roughly 3, 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant, the largest in the Lone Star State.Still, it is enough to capture 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  —   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3.From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation, the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic, with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant’s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors.That solution is pumped to a regenerator, or stripper, which heats the amine and releases the CO2.The gas will be injected into wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, that should increase production to 15, 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day.And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project, what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation.Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris, he said: “We’re not going to declare victory before it’s time.” But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy.So far, problems have bedeviled major projects, often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete.Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  —   a problem known as “parasitic load.The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less, thanks to lessons learned this time around.Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially, he said.“You cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  —   you really have to do this stuff in the real world,” he said.Driving down costs, he noted, is what engineers and businesses do through research, development and production.He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power.“We do figure things out as we go,” he said.But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope.“I think he was intrigued” about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix, she added.And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation, it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants, but also carbon dioxide.Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses, too, were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology, since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election.What’s it look like over the life of this plant?“I wouldn’t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry,” he said, but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications.In a $140 million, 50 megawatt demonstration project, the company, Net Power, will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines.The power plant produces a stream of very pure, pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require.The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants, the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine.The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process.And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  —   “rapid unplanned disassembly”  —   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence.“We see this very much playing into all parts of the world,” said Daniel McCarthy, executive vice president for CBI’s technology operating group.“This is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community,” he said.Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal, with all of its environmental baggage, in the energy mix.And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don’t pollute the atmosphere in the first place.“It’s convenient to just say ‘Keep it in the ground,’ ” he said, referring to an   slogan.“What I prefer to say is ‘Keep it from the air.
