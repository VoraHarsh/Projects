'When Walt Disney’s “Bambi” opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before.The extent of his contribution to “Bambi,” which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades.A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century.But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public.But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for “Bambi” that Mr. Wong was  —   belatedly  —   most renowned.“He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation.25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province.As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father.But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire.The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face?How many windows are in your house?Where in the house is the rice bin?How wide is your well?How deep?Are there trees in your village?Are there lakes?What shops can you name?The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match.For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation.To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers.The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.Gen Yeo would undergo it alone.On Dec.However, she continued: “The goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming.“I was scared half to death I just cried,” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus,” an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015.“Every day is just miserable  —   miserable.I hated that place.” On Jan.His father had already been questioned.Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error.For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son.They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel.After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day.His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper.When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high.His father scraped together the $90 tuition  —   a small fortune  —   to let him stay on as Otis’s youngest student.He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s.Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own.One   flung a racial epithet at him.Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria.In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse.In an attempt to use a similar style for “Bambi,” it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered.“I said, ‘Gee, this is all outdoor scenery,’” he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: “I said, ‘Gee, I’m a landscape painter!’” Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A.D. 960 —  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  —   at once lush and spare  —   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush.“He said, ‘I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest.’” Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist.“But he was more than that,” Mr. Canemaker explained.“He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out.He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people.” Throughout the finished film  —   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  —   his influence is unmistakable.Though he had chosen not to strike  —   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  —   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments.On “Bambi,” Mr. Wong’s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere “background” artist.The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios.“Then in a month you’d go back there and the sign was still there,” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus.“If World War II hadn’t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,” Ms. See said.“And that’s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war.After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again.When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him.Yet he would not let them have coloring books.The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.
