'Finally.They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn.They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations.“I was very choked up,” Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon.” It was a major moment for New York’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach.4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation’s most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  —   all familiar sights across the system.It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line.With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March.The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation’s infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems.Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place.With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow.So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads.4 billion.On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls.“I don’t think I’ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,” she said through tears.” She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance.“Representation matters,” they agreed.“There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,” Ms. Harihareswara said.After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007.Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time.Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority’s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency.Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot.On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station.The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups.there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station.Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators.Parents became upset.“We’ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,” the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair.“Hopefully, it’s almost ready for us.At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi.The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there.” Mr. Braith, 77, said.In Mr. Braith’s mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one.” a   asked, seeing the hubbub.” Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line.“I feel like I’ve been waiting for this train my whole life,” he said, seemingly speaking for many others.
