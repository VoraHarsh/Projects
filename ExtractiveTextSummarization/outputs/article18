'MUMBAI, India  —   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire.Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as “black money,” flowing through the country’s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption.But, he said, “We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me.Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless.Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov.8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning.With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side.He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good.“Modi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can’t tackle   problems like corruption.We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones.“When I first read the news, I couldn’t even figure out if it was true.” The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  —   more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it.Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless.Whether Mr. Modi’s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate.Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy.But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones.And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say.People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected.“You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,” he said.He cast the opposition as “people who don’t want change, who don’t want reform,” Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes.But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable.Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said.As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat.They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said.He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes.“So if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?” he asked.“We can’t shift to a cashless mode overnight,” he said.In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said.But doing so depends on Mr. Modi’s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban.“So far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,” Mr. Pant said.“He thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don’t know.There are so many unknowns.
