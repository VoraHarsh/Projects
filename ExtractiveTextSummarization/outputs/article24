'Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michael’s “Freedom!’90” a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a  .Directed by David Fincher, who was at the start of his film career, and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London, the video from Mr. Michael’s 1990 album, “Listen Without Prejudice Vol.1,” brought together five models  —   Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  —   who were then the queens of fashion.’90” had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michael’s unexpected death at 53 last Sunday.Reached by phone this week, some of the participants recalled their experiences on set, and some of the video’s most ardent fans reflected on its impact.Naomi Campbell, model.What would it take to get you?” We were living in America, so I said you’d have to fly us in, basically.I said yes, and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in.The last show finished at around 3 o’clock in the morning, and George was there.So from there I went back to my hotel, packed my bags and went on the first flight to London.David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted.Cindy was sultry.I don’t think any of us knew what it would become.We knew the song was a hit, but we didn’t know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos, the way it would affect people.They don’t have them anymore.Not that I’ve seen.MTV’s changed.We all did the finale, and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing “Freedom.” After, he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice   in the garden, and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together.George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue.It was a different time then.They weren’t playing characters.They were playing themselves.It wasn’t like I said, “Oh, dye your hair blond,” not at all.At the time, we really didn’t realize how iconic the video would become.Tatjana Patitz, model.I was in my own zone.I think I may have had a bustier on.And I was smoking, even.People still smoked in videos then and even in films.Glamour was very present in fashion in those days, feminine glamour, people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the ’40s and ’50s  —   Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner.A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers.It was very different those days.We were part of the entertainment industry, which made it really fun.George was very nice, almost a little shy.Maybe that’s the wrong word.In the five or so times I met him, he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid, not one of those vivacious,   people who take a room by storm.I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter.I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that.It’s not like you look at “Freedom!’90” now and say, “Oh, my God, it’s so ’80s!” It’s not like “Working Girl.’” Of course I said yes.I was a big George Michael fan.That wasn’t rehearsed.Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way, never cheap and tawdry.” Then he said, “Do you mind doing it for nothing?” I said, “No way.And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy,    jobs, everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models.I really didn’t realize how big it all was at the time.So when the video of “Freedom!” came out and they were all in it, we were obsessed.She was my favorite.We did the whole thing naked under white sheets.After the very last chorus, we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas.We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were, whether it was Madonna with “Vogue” and “Truth or Dare” or George Michael with “Freedom!” I don’t know if he was openly gay or not, then.I guess not.To be open would have been a career killer.But going to a club, listening to “Freedom!,” it was an escape.I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didn’t know where my career had gone.I’d left MTV.My agent wasn’t calling.It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills.It was such a brilliant   capstone I’d ever heard.It was his    song.” And he just steps away.He wasn’t even in the video.Zac Posen, fashion designer.I was 10 years old, 10 or 11.” was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge.Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial, Corinne Day,   space.
