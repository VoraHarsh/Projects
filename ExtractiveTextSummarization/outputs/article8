'Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage.When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec.“I’ve got my life back,” he declared.” Mr. Cahill left the show’s stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar.But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts.In fact, most of that season’s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously.Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science.Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the “Biggest Loser” contestants for six years after that victorious night.The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise.They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss.“I am just blown away.When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes.So they were not surprised to see that “The Biggest Loser” contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended.It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight.As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size.The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation’s obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults.Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology.And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is “new and important.“As long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back.” The show’s doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestants’ metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop.But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off.The study’s findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity.And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people.Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back.And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  —   it may be an effect of aging  —   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend.First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail.He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight.But, he added, the findings made sense.“If they don’t show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?It means we need to explore other approaches.” Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss.“There is a lot of basic research we still need to do,” said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer.With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry.And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size.“Two treats can turn into a binge over a   period.The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week.“All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,” Mr. Cahill said.I said, ‘This is not right.Something is wrong with my body.He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show.“It’s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,” he said.Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though.The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin.By the season’s finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time.In a   study funded by Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks.Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people.Its level rose.“The body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight.We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use.” Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade.He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon.Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485.“I used to look at myself and think, ‘I am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,’” he said.Walking hurt stairs were agony.“I remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit.He tried three times and was finally selected.And rigorous it was.Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own.The idea was to lose a pound a day.His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a.m.Have breakfast  —   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast.Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym.Work out for two and a half hours.Rest for an hour.If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more.They wore compression undergarments to hold it in.He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended.Soon the scale hit 265.He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds.He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few.Then I’d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, ‘What did I do?Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the body’s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss.Still, pounds can insidiously creep on.“These very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  —   less than one Starburst candy  —   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating.The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said.He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo.Those taking the drug gradually lost weight.And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry.All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say.But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer.“There are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,” he said, but he added that “for most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  —   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months.“The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,” he said.And with his report from Dr. Hall’s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain.“That shame that was on my shoulders went off,” he said.
