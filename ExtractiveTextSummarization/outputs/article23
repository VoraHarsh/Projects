'PARIS  —   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria’s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry.But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects, mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites.“Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details, every crack and hole, and we can take very precise measurements,” said Mr. Ubelmann, who founded the company Iconem.“This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need.The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored, repaired or reconstructed.“The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion,” he said.“We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture.It became a war of images.9, many of the 40, 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays.” He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion “in the face of the devastation of unique heritage.“We were working pro bono, not for any government, but to help the archaeologists,” he said.They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists, he said, adding, “We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own.” What is paramount is memory and potential restoration.In the last year, his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria.In 2015, Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign.The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable.But these were barely scratching the surface.Before the war, close to 150 archaeological projects were underway, just in Syria, researchers said.There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing.“We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites,” he said.“Important evidence, like clandestine pits, can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion.While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts, they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money.Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed, objects carted off, safes stolen.Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest, condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as “war crimes.” This past month, France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates, provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments.“Should we be concerned about the patrimony?” he asked.“What is more important, saving lives or saving stones?In reality, these two are inseparable.
