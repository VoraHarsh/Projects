'WASHINGTON  —   The most powerful and ambitious   Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life  —   refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration.Even before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan.Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation.“And we intend to do it.” But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks.(On Saturday, he offered New Year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do.”) Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code.Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate.But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink.The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  .“You have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time.“Democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy.“I think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.” In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining.That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration.But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion.Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities.They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use.Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act.They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  —   already a quarter over  —   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster.Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome.“The senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer.Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia.Democrats  —   and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  —   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election.While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well.“You have to perform.
