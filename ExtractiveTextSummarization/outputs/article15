'It’s the season for family travel and photos  —   and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home.There are, of course, the usual print services and methods.You can choose a glossy or matte finish, print a photo on canvas, or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly, professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix, or drugstores and   chains like Walgreens and Costco.But the web is also home to many   printing services, as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display, be it burlap, wood boards, acrylic or    fabric.Why not try some fresh sites and methods?I recently sent some   quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I’d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces.I’ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation, then with a   home.I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry.And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch.Parabo Press is a breeze to use: It’s clean and easy to read, your options are straightforward, and there are no annoying upsells.The site also offers prints on metal, glass, newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine, which uses   ink and is described by Parabo as having “a cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan.” A fabric print  —   not soft like a bedsheet, more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric  —   is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement.Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it, you can peel and stick it on your wall.The site’s fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls, glass, ceilings, tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco, concrete blocks, brick, unfinished wood, canvas or freshly painted walls).SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54, from less than $2 to about $80.I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34.99, a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon  —   not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but you’re printing on special material.Regardless of the cost, I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls, after all) but I was pleasantly surprised.PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments.I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service.I didn’t have a problem, but if time is of the essence, you may want to check with the company before placing an order.Once you’ve turned the best of your travel photos into art, it’s time to store the rest.If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space, there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives, slides and videos) so you can store them digitally.But there are several things to keep in mind.In general, these sites are a pain to navigate.They’re cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options  —   Do you want your photos scanned in order?Do you want both sides of the photo scanned?—   that if you don’t have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed.Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan.Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files.ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi.A thumb drive is an additional $15.95 a box.To find the best   place to scan photos and film, the Wirecutter, a consumer review site owned by The New York Times, researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders.Memories Renewed took the number one spot.The company, based in Minneapolis, Minn.offered “the best combination of price, quality, and turnaround time of any service we tested,” Wirecutter said.I was planning to try the service however, according to the Memories Renewed site, demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months.Scanning photos of any size up to 8.5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB.Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity.That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want   prints or have thousands of photos to scan.Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely   activity.That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times.But I was still glad for it.Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again.And you can’t beat the price.
