'SYDNEY, Australia  —   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne, Australia’s   city, is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement.“It’s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem,” said Anthony Boxshall, the agency’s manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals.A “good” rating means that the water is suitable for swimming.“Fair” means that rainfall has affected the water.“Poor” means people should avoid it.Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual.“I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now I’m concerned about whether the water is clean.The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops.
