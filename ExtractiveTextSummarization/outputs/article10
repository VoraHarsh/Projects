'With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry.Up, up and away soared the offers  —   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day.In the end, the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million, more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  —   oil leases  —   in the Gulf of Mexico.Who won the bid?On a global scale, more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy.That is more than $300 billion a year, a sign of how powerful the momentum has become.The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair.Now, of course, everything is in flux.Yet despair might be an overreaction.They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy.Efforts to roll those back have largely failed, with the latest development coming only last week, when Gov.The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy, and they will surely become a target in the new Congress.That state  —     in presidential politics, let us remember  —   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power.When I spoke with him last week, Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era.By his group’s calculations, $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years.So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance, what about the international effort against global warming?That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried.While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming, that consensus is fragile, he pointed out.The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality.Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw.Right now, other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so, but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling.Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge.Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do, but rather what he will not do.While the energy transition is real, it is still in its earliest stages.The transition is simply not happening fast enough.The pledges countries made in Paris, even if kept, are not ambitious enough.So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy, seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse.Later this month, global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014.If nothing else, the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality.
