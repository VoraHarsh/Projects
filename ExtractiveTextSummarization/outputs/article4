'Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn’t necessarily evenhanded.The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69.He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue.Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis.As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too?Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  —   I hesitate to say merry  —   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song.” It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death.George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas.So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw.If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene.No figure among them was as towering as Ali.Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen.But he was more than a great athlete.Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way.Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title.But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth.Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring.The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack.An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too.He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  —   but he was somehow one of them, too.And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras.Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin.In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country.Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past.But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  —   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales.Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief.And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had.And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork  Mindy,” “Laverne  Shirley” and more, died at 81.The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world.That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  —   what a picture!—   had split from the scene.The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ’80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time.And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude.Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go.Which brings us to Marion Pritchard.Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound.By her estimate she saved 150 people.How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess.But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.
